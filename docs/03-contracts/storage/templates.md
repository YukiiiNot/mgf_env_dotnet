---

## Key Takeaways

- This document describes a canonical contract boundary.
- Consumers should rely on Contracts rather than host internals.
- Changes must preserve compatibility or be versioned.

---

## System Context

Contracts define stable boundaries between UseCases, Services, and Data.

---

## Core Concepts

This document describes the contract intent and expected usage. Implementation details belong in code.

---

## How This Evolves Over Time

- Update when schema or interface changes are introduced.
- Note compatibility expectations when fields evolve.

---

## Common Pitfalls and Anti-Patterns

- Changing contract shapes without versioning.
- Embedding host-specific types into Contracts.

---

## When to Change This Document

- The contract or schema changes.
- New consumers depend on this boundary.
