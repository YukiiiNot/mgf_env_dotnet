# Documentation Style Guide

## File and heading conventions
- Use kebab-case filenames.
- Use a single H1 title at the top of each document.

## Contracts and runbooks
- Include `Source of truth`, `Change control`, and `Last verified` lines near the top.

## Link hygiene
- Prefer relative links within `docs/`.
- Keep canonical artifact paths stable.
